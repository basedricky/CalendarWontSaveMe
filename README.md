## User Story

```
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```


## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```


## Project Details
```

I have created a simple daily planner page that will take user inputs into the text field and save them to Local storage. In addition, the time blocks will be dynamically colored based on if the time block is in the past, current, or future. After finishing this, It would have been much quicker, I think, to dynamically genearate the page via Javascript. I was jsut having some trouble getting the layout exactly how I'd like.
